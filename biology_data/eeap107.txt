7. Experiments with Water
What floats – what sinks?

Ayesha was waiting for dinner. Today Ammi was making her


favourite food – puri and spicy potatoes.


Ayesha watched as her mother rolled out the puri and put


it in the hot oil. She saw that at first the puri sank to the


bottom of the pan. As it puffed up, the puri came up and


started floating on the oil. One puri did not puff up and did


not float like the others. On seeing this, Ayesha took some


dough and rolled it into a ball. She flattened it and put it in


a bowl of water. Alas! it sank to the bottom and stayed there.

Think what would happen if

Ayesha
put
a
puffed
puri
in
a
bowl
of
water.
Would
it sink or float?

You
put
a
steel
plate
on
water.
Would
it
sink
or
float? What would happen to a spoon?

Would
the
cap
of
a
plastic
bottle
sink
or float on water?

In the evening Ayesha went for


a bath. She had just come out


when her mother called, “Ayesha,


you have dropped the soap in the


water again. Take it out and put it


in the soap case.” Ayesha was in a


hurry and the soap case fell out of

her hands. It started floating on water. Ayesha


gently put the soap in the soap case. She saw


that the case continued to float, even with the

soap in it.

Have you seen that some thing float on


water while others sink? Think how this


happens! The poem here raises such

questions.
Why, Oh Why?
A wooden boat
in water will float.
But a needle will sink!
Why does this happen?

Let me think...


An iron ship

will also float,
though its’ much heavier
than my boat!
But a needle,
light as a leaf,
thin as a pin,
will sink right in!
Why does this happen?
Let me think...

Do this and find out

Do this experiment in groups of four friends. Each group


will need a big pot filled with water and the things


listed in the table. Put each thing one-by-one in water


and observe. Write your observations in the table given

on the next page.

Find out from the other groups which things floated and which

After doing the experiment, fill in the blanks.

1. The iron nail ______ in water but the katori ______. I think


this happened because _________________________________


2. The empty plastic bottle ______ on water. The bottle filled


with water ______ because ______________________________


3. The aluminium foil ______ when it was spread out. When


pressed tightly into a ball it __________. This may have

I saw, when I
did it


 
Is it magic?

When Ayesha woke up in the morning, Ammi had fever. Abbu made


some tea and went to give medicines to Ammi. He told Ayesha, “You

boil eggs. Also put some salt in the water.” Ayesha took water in
a pot. By mistake she put too much salt in the water. She saw
the eggs at the bottom of the pot come up a little and start to
float in water!

Take
some
water
in
a
glass.
Put
a
lemon
in
it.
Now
keep
putting salt in the water, half-a-spoon at a time. Were you
able to float your lemon in water?

What
do
you
think,
the
lemon
floated
in
salty
water,
because......
Dead Sea

All oceans and seas have salty water. The saltiest of all is


the Dead Sea. How salty? Imagine 300 grams of salt in one


litre of water! Would you be able to even taste such salty


water? It would be very bitter. Interestingly, even if a person


does not know how to swim, she would not drown in this

sea. She will float in water, as if lying down on it!
Remember the lemon you floated in salty water?
What dissolved, what did not?

On Sunday Ayesha’s cousin brother Hamid came to her house


to play. As soon as he came he asked his aunt to make his


favourite shakkarpara (a sweet dish). Ammi said, “Let me come


back from the market, then I will make some for you. Why


don’t you help me? Take two glasses of water and put a bowl of


sugar in it. Mix it till it dissolves.” Hamid thought, “Let me

finish this work fast. Then I will watch TV”.

Suggest
some
ways
to
Hamid
for
quickly
dissolving
sugar.

Teacher’s Note : It is not expected that children should be told about density. We


should accept different answers that children may give, such as water is ‘heavy’ or

‘thick’.

Do this experiment

Make groups of four friends. For the experiment you will


need 4-5 glasses or bowls, spoons, water, and the things


listed in the table. Take some water in each glass. Now try


to dissolve one thing in one glass. Observe what happens

and note in the table.
Things
1. Salt
2. Soil
3. Chalk powder
4. 1 spoon milk
5. Oil
Did it dissolve
or not?
What happened after
keeping for 2 minutes?
Tell

Could
you
see
the
salt
after
it
dissolved
in
water?
If
no,
why?

Does
that
mean
that
now
the
water
does
not
have
salt?
If it has, then where is the salt?

What
difference
did
you
see
–
in
the
water
with
salt,
and

the water with chalk powder – after keeping for sometime?


Which
of
the
two
would
you
be
able
to
separate
from
the
water by straining with a cloth – salt or chalk powder?

Teacher’s Note : There are many things which cannot be easily labelled as soluble


or insoluble. These categories are anyway not needed here. Children need to be

encouraged to fill the table on the basis of their own observations.

Looking Around


 

While doing the experiment Ayesha and Hamid had an


argument. Ayesha felt that after stirring it, the oil dissolved in


water. Hamid did not agree. He said, “Look, the tiny yellow oil


drops can still be seen in the water”. Ayesha said, “Let’s wait

for sometime and then see.”

Do
you
think
the
oil
got
dissolved
in
the
water?
Why
do
you think so?
Racing drops

Ayesha put two drops of oil on the lid


of her tiffin box. Next to that she put


two drops of water and two drops of


sugar solution. She tilted the lid. She


saw some drops slid down quickly,

while some were left behind.

You
also
try
to
do
the
same
and
then
tell
–
which
drop
went
ahead?
Why did it slide faster?
Where did the water go?

One day Ayesha’s mother put some water to boil on the


stove for making tea. She got busy with something and


forgot about it. When she remembered and came to check,

she found very little water left in the pan.

Think
where
did
the
water
go?

Why
did
Chittibabu
and
Chinnababu
keep
their
mango
jelly in the sun?

At
your

what

Dandi March
This incident took place in 1930, before

India became independent. For many


years the British had made a law that


did not allow people to make salt


themselves. They had also put a heavy

tax on salt. By this law people could not
make salt even for use at home. “How
can anybody live without salt?” Gandhiji
said, “How can a law not allow us to use
freely
what
nature
has
given
!”
Gandhiji,

with several other people, went on a yatra

(long walk) from Ahmedabad to the Dandi
seashore in Gujarat, to protest against
this law.
Do you know how salt is made? The sea
water is collected in shallow beds dug in the
sand. Water is allowed to dry in the sun. After
the water dries the salt remains on the ground.
What we have learnt

You
have
washed
your
handkerchief
and
you
want
to dry it quickly. What all can you do?

What
things
do
you
put
in
water
to
make
tea?
Which
of those things dissolves in water?

You
have
been
given
some
mishri
pieces
(lumps
of

sugar). Suggest some ways to dissolve them quickly.


Teacher’s Note : Children of this age cannot be expected to understand the


concept of ‘evaporation’ but they can begin to think about it. ‘Dandi Yatra’ can

provide a context to talk about the struggle for Independence.
