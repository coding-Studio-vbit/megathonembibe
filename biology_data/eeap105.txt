5. Seeds and Seeds

Gopal was waiting for his mausi’s family to visit them. They will


be coming the next day for their holidays. He was thinking


about all the fun and nice food that he would have with his


cousins. Just then his mother called out, “Gopal, before you


sleep, remember to soak two small bowls (katoris) of chana


(gram).” She was going to his Bua’s house and would return

only
in
the
morning.

As he was soaking the chana, Gopal thought, “How will two


small bowls of this be enough for eight persons?” So he soaked


another two bowls of chana. When his mother returned the


next morning, she saw that the chana were overflowing

from the vessel. “How much did you soak?” asked his
mother. “How did that happen!” wondered Gopal.
“You soaked too much! Anyway it is good, now I
will cook half of them, and leave the other half to
sprout. I can send these to your aunt. The doctor
has told her to eat sprouts”, mother said. She

tied half of the soaked chana in a wet cloth,

and hung them up to sprout.

Project : Plant your seeds

Take a clay pot or a tin can with a wide mouth. Make


a small hole at the bottom of the can. Fill your can with


soil. Put four or five seeds of the same kind in the soil


and press them gently. Different groups can plant


different kinds of seeds, such as mustard (sarson),


fenugreek (methi), sesame (til) or coriander (dhania).

Write
Name of the seed : ____________

The date on which you planted them: ___________


The day you observe something coming out of

the soil, start filling the table:

plant (in cm)

then measure it

Trapped!
Plants which hunt!

There are some plants which trap and eat


frogs, insects and even mice. The Pitcher


plant (Nepenthese) is one such plant. It is


found in Australia, Indonesia and Meghalaya


in India. It has a pitcher-like shape and the


mouth is covered by a leaf. The plant has a


special smell that attracts insects to it. When


the insect lands on the mouth of the plant,


it gets trapped and cannot get out. What a

clever way to hunt!
So many seeds!

How many types of seeds can you collect?


Where will you find them? Each of you


should try to collect as many different


types of seeds as you can. After that, put


all the seed collections together. Now


observe these seeds carefully – their


shapes, sizes, colours, textures (smooth

Wandering seeds

Plants cannot move around. Once they


grow, they remain in the same place. But


their seeds are great travellers! They can


reach far and wide. Look at picture 1 on the

next page and see the flying seeds.

Look at picture 2. This seed cannot fly, but it can still


travel by sticking on to the fur of animals or on our clothes.


In this way it gets a free ride! Did you get any new idea from


these seeds? Read how the idea of Velcro came to George

Mestral.

This happened in 1948. One day George Mestral came


back from a walk with his dog. He was amazed to find


seeds sticking all over his clothes and on his dog’s fur.


He wondered what made them stick. So he observed these seeds


under a microscope. He saw that the seeds had many tiny hooks


which got stuck to clothes or fur. This gave Mestral the idea of


making Velcro. He made a material with similar tiny hooks that


would stick. Velcro is used to stick together many things – clothes,


shoes, bags, belts and many more. What a way to take inspiration

from nature!

Look at the pictures given below and guess how the seeds
travel and reach different places.

Some
plants
spread
their
seeds
over
long
distances.
When

the soyabean pods are ripe, they burst and the seeds are

thrown out. Have you ever heard their sound?

Think
what
would
happen,
if
seeds
did
not
spread
and
remained at one place only.

Make
a
list
of
the
different
ways
by
which
seeds
are
spread.
Who came from where?

Have you included human beings also in your list?


Yes, we also carry seeds from one place to another,

knowingly
or
unknowingly.
We
bring
the
seeds
of
plants
that
we
find
beautiful
or
useful,
to
grow
them
in
our

garden. Later the seeds of these plants spread to other


places. Many years later people may not even remember


that these plants did not grow here earlier. They were


brought from somewhere else. Do you know from where


chillies came to our country? These were brought to


India by traders coming from South America. Today

we cannot think of food without chillies!

Read this poem to know which plant came from where.
Did you know this?
From South America
long ago,
came a tomato,
a potato,
and a green chilli.
Do you know this?
A cabbage came
from Europe,
and also a pea.
From Africa

came a coffee bean,


and a green bhindi.

They crossed the land.
They crossed the sea.
Did you know this?

(Bhindi is also called okra, and methi is

called fenugreek)
A mango sang,
‘Come in! Come in!’
An orange smiled
inside its skin.
‘Welcome to India,’
a banana said.

the methi and spinach,

brinjal and radish,
nodded its head.
Did you know this?

Chakmak, May-June 2002


(Translated by Anupa Lal)


What all was grown in India long ago? Were mangoes and


bananas grown here? What came from other countries?

Imagine food without potatoes or tomatoes!
