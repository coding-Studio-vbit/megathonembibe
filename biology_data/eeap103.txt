3. From Tasting to Digesting
Different tastes

Jhumpa ran into the kitchen and caught hold of her mother


saying, “Ma, I am not going to eat this bitter karela (bittergourd).


Give me gur (jaggery) and roti.” Ma smiled and said, “You ate roti

and
sugar
in
the
morning.”
Jhoolan
teased
Jhumpa,
“Don’t

you get bored of only one kind of taste?” Jhumpa replied


quickly, “Do you get bored with licking imli (tarmarind)? I bet


your mouth is watering just by hearing the word imli.” “Sure I


love the sour imli. But I eat sweet and salty things too. I even


eat karela,” said Jhoolan and looked at her mother. They both

laughed heartily.

Jhoolan said to Jhumpa, “Let’s play a game. You close your


eyes and open your mouth. I will put something to eat in your

mouth.
You
have
to
tell
what
it
is.”
Jhoolan
took
a
few
drops

of lemon juice in a spoon and put them in Jhumpa’s mouth.

“Sour lemon,” Jhumpa replied quickly.

Looking Around


 

Jhoolan then picked up a small piece of jaggery. Her mother


suggested, “Crush it, otherwise she will know what it is?”


Jhoolan crushed the jaggery but Jhumpa easily guessed it.


They played the game with different food items. Jhumpa could


tell the fried fish even before tasting it. Jhoolan said, “Now


close your nose, and tell me what this is?” Jhumpa was


confused, “It is a bit bitter, a little salty and somewhat sour.


Give me one more spoonful.” Jhoolan took another spoonful


of the cooked karela, uncovered Jhumpa’s eyes, and said,

“Here it is, eat!” Jhumpa laughed, “Yes, give me more.”

taste?
What

item?

On
which

tongue
could
you

get the most taste – in front, at the back,

on the left or right side of the tongue?

Teacher's Note : Encourage children to be creative and to explore their vocabulary


to describe different kinds of flavours. Discuss how the combination of different


flavours brings so much variety in our food. Different combinations of taste (such


as sweet-sour, hot-spicy) may be discussed in the class to develop this understanding.

Teacher's Note : On page 27, children are not expected to draw the ‘digestive


system.’ Encourage children to imagine and express their own ideas about what


happens to the food in their body. Encourage sharing of pictures and free

discussion, without any judgement of right or wrong.

Nitu was given a glucose drip

Nitu was very sick. All day she was


vomiting and she also had loose


motions. Whatever she ate, she

vomited.
Her
father
gave
her
sugar

and salt solution. By evening Nitu was


feeling weak and dizzy. When she got


up to go to the doctor she fainted.


Her father had to carry her to the


doctor. The doctor said that Nitu should get


admitted in the hospital. She needs to be given a


glucose drip. Hearing this, Nitu got confused. She knew


that during the games period in school, the teacher


sometimes gave them glucose to drink. But what was a


glucose drip? Doctor aunty explained, “Your stomach is


upset. Your body is not keeping any food and water and it


has become very weak. The glucose drip will give you some

strength quickly, even without eating.”
Talk and discuss

Do you remember that in Class IV you made a solution of


sugar and salt? Nitu’s father also made this and gave her.


Why do you think this is given to someone who has

vomiting and loose motions?

Have
you
heard
the
word
‘glucose’,
or
seen
it
written
anywhere? Where?

Teacher's Note : Discuss with children about how glucose is used. It is too


abstract for children to understand how glucose gives energy. You may like to


invite a doctor to talk to the children. It is not expected that children will understand

all the details at this stage.

Martin’s Window
Here’s an old story
it seems so funny!
There was a window
in Martin’s tummy!
Actually by mistake
Martin was shot.
Right in the stomach
it bled a lot!

The wound slowly healed


and was covered by skin.

But the hole was still there
you could peep right in!
Oh! what a chance
for doctors to study.
What happens to the food
inside the body!
The story seems odd
but it is really true.
The secret of Martin’s stomach
helped us all - me and you!

Story – A Stomach with a Window

In the poem, you read about a soldier called Martin. In 1822, he was


eighteen years old and was very healthy. When he was shot, he got


seriously hurt. At that time Dr. Beaumont was called to treat him.


Dr. Beaumont cleaned the wound and put the dressing. After one and


a half years, the doctor found that Martin’s wound had healed except


for one thing. He had a big hole in his stomach. The hole was covered


with a loose flap of skin, like the washer in a football. Press the skin


and you could peep into Martin’s stomach! Not only that, the doctor


could also take out food from the stomach by putting a tube in the


hole. Dr. Beaumont felt he had found a treasure. Can you guess how


much time he spent on doing different experiments on this stomach?

Nine years! During this time Martin grew up and got married.

At that time scientists did not know how food was digested? How


does the liquid (digestive juices) in the stomach help? Does it only help

in making the food wet and soft? Or does it also help in digestion?

Dr. Beaumont took some liquid (juices) out of the stomach. He wanted


to see what would happen to a food item kept in a glass filled with it.

Would it get digested on its own? For this he did an
experiment. With the help of a tube, he took out
some digestive juice from the stomach. At
8.30am he put twenty tiny pieces of boiled
fish in 10 millilitres of the juice. He kept the
glass at the same temperature as that
of
our
stomach
–
about

30°C. When he checked at


2pm he found that the


pieces of fish had dissolved.


Dr. Beaumont tried this


experiment with different


food items. He gave Martin


the same food at the same time and then compared how long it took for


food to be digested in the glass and in Martin’s stomach. He recorded

his observations in a table.
30
Looking Around


 
Here is a part of his observation table:
No. Food item
1. Unboiled milk
2. Boiled milk

3. Full boiled egg


4. Half boiled egg

5. Raw egg, beaten
6. Raw egg
Time taken for digestion
In the stomach
2 hours 15 minutes
2 hours
3 hours 30 minutes

3 hours


2 hours

1 hour 30 minutes
So, what does our stomach do?

Dr. Beaumont did many experiments and found out many secrets


about digestion. He found that food digests faster in the stomach than

outside. Did you notice this in the table?

Our stomach churns the food to digest it. The doctor also saw that the


food did not digest properly when Martin was sad. He also found that the


juice in our stomach is acidic. Have you heard of anyone talking about


acidity – especially when that person has not eaten well or the food is not

digested properly.

Dr. Beaumont’s experiments became famous across the world. After


this many scientists did many such experiments. What did you say? No,


they did not shoot people in the stomach. Nor did they wait for a patient


with a hole in the stomach. They used other scientific ways to look inside

our bodies.
Did you like the story of Martin or, should we say, the story of our
own stomach?

Think and discuss

Imagine if you had been in place of Dr. Beaumont, what


experiments would you have done to find out the secrets of our

stomach? Write about your experiments.

Teacher's Note : This story is to introduce children to the method of science and


the passion with which scientists pursue their experiments. It is not necessary

that children should understand the story about digestion in all its detail.

Good food, good health

Dr. Aparna has two patients – Rashmi and Kailash.


Dr. Aparna talked to them to find out more about them.

Read what the doctor found.

Rashmi, 5 years


Kailash, 7 years


She looks about 3 years old. She


has very thin arms and legs and a


pot belly (stomach like a balloon).

She often falls sick.

She always feels tired and cannot


go to school regularly. She does not

have the strength even to play.

Food : She is lucky if she can get a


little rice or one roti to eat in the

whole day.

He looks older than his age. His


body is fat and flabby. He has pain


in his legs. He is not very active. He


goes to school by bus and spends

many hours watching TV.

Food : He does not like to eat home-


cooked food like dal-rice, vegetables


and roti. The only thing he finds


tasty are chips, burger, pizzas and


soft drinks from the market.


Dr. Aparna measured the height and weight of both the


children. Then she told them, there is only one treatment

for both your problems – proper food!

You have read about two children. One is Kailash who does not


like home-made food. The other one is Rashmi who does not


even get one proper meal a day. About half the children in our


country are like Rashmi. They do not get enough food that they


need to grow and develop properly. These children are weak and


sickly (often ill, in poor-health). But it is the right of every child

to get proper food.

Read about this story in
Kalahandi district in Orissa.
Think and discuss

 Do you know any child


who does not get enough


to eat in the whole day?


What are the reasons for

this?

Gomti is thirty years old. Gomti


works in the fields of a rich


farmer. For all her hard work,


she gets paid very little. So little


that she cannot even buy


enough rice to feed her family.


Some months she does not get


any work at all. Then she has


to eat leaves and roots from the


jungle. Gomti’s children are


weak with hunger and always


sick. Few years ago her

husband died of hunger.

Most rice grows in Kalahandi


district. Rice is even sent to


other states from here. Many


times the rice that keeps lying


in the godowns gets spoiled. In


the same Kalahandi there are


many, many poor people like


Gomti. Why do people die of

hunger in such a place?
