4. Mangoes Round the Year
Hey, today
Nitu has

Wow! Aman’s

Teacher’s Note : Let children give examples of food spoilage based on their own


experiences. It is important to explain the difference between food spoilage and


wastage of food. The experiment with bread can be started when you begin the

lesson, because it will need to continue over six days at least.

Biji returned the bread

Aman’s Biji went to the market to buy bread. The shop was


very crowded. The shopkeeper picked up a packet of bread


and gave it to Biji. She looked at it and returned it immediately.

Teacher’s Note : Help children to read and note the information on the packets


regarding weight, date of packing etc. While doing the experiment precautions


need to be taken depending on the weather conditions – e.g. the bread should not


be allowed to dry up, there should be some ventilation in the room. Do put up the

chart in the classroom and remind the children to fill it in every day.

How does food get spoilt?
The whole class can do this

experiment together. Take a piece of


bread or roti. Sprinkle a few drops of


water on it, and put it in a box. Close


the box. See the bread or roti

everyday until you find some
changes on it.

Make this table on a chart paper


and put it up in the classroom.


Fill up the chart every day after

discussing the changes seen.

Summer treat – Mamidi tandra


Chittibabu and Chinnababu live in Atreyapuram town in Andhra


Pradesh. The brothers spend the summer holidays playing in


the mango garden, when the trees are full of fruits. They also

like to eat unripe mangoes with salt and chilly powder.

At home, their mother cooks unripe mangoes in different


ways. She also makes many kinds of mango pickles. The pickles

last through the year until the next mango season.

One evening, while having food Chinnababu asked, “Amma,


we have so many mangoes. Make some mamidi tandra (aam


papad) from them.”


Their father said, “Making mamidi tandra needs four weeks of


hardwork. If you both promise to help us everyday for the next


four weeks, we can together make the mamidi tandra.”


Both the brothers quickly agreed to help. The next day both


the children went to the market with their father. They bought


a mat woven from the leaves of a palm tree, poles of casuarina

tree, string made of coconut husk, some jaggery and sugar.

Amma found a sunny place in the backyard. Both the brothers


made a high platform by using poles. They spread out and tied

the mat on that platform.

The next day, Appa chose the most ripe mangoes. They took


out the mango pulp into a large pot. Then they strained the


pulp through a fine muslin cloth, to remove the fibres from the


pulp. Then Chittibabu crushed the gur (jaggery) till there were


no lumps. They added the jaggery and sugar in equal amounts

to the pulp. Chinnababu mixed the jaggery and sugar well with


a big spoon. Amma then spread this pulp into a thin layer over


the mat. The thin layer was left to dry in the sun. In the evening,

they covered the mat with a clean saree to avoid any dust.

The next day they again took out some mango pulp. They


added jaggery and sugar into the pulp. Then they spread the


pulp over the previous day’s layer. This work was given to both


the brothers. Both of them together spread many layers over it.

For the next four weeks they hoped that it would not rain.

For four weeks, they added layer after layer until the jelly


grew four centimetres thick and looked like a golden cake. After


some days Amma said, “The mamidi tandra is ready, we can

take it out and cut it into pieces tomorrow.”

The next day, the mat was brought down from the platform.


Mamidi tandra was cut into smaller pieces. The brothers tasted


it. It was tasty. Chhinnababu said, “Wow, how tasty! After all we

have also helped in making it.”
