9. Up You Go!
Mountaineering Camp
Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi

We were at the mountaineering camp


and were very excited. Twenty of us were


teachers from Kendriya Vidyalayas.


There were other women from banks and

other institutions.

Today was the second day of the camp.


In the morning as I got out of bed and


put my foot down, I screamed in pain. I


remembered yesterday’s 26 kilometre walk with the heavy

rucksack
on
my
back.
I
was
afraid
to
go
back
to
that
steep
climb and the rough narrow path.

With tears in my eyes I started walking slowly towards the


room of Brigadier Gyan Singh, the Director of our adventure


course. I was thinking of what I would say to excuse myself

from that day’s trek. Suddenly, I heard his deep voice
from behind.
“Madam, what are you doing here at breakfast
time? Hurry up! Otherwise you will have to trek
on an empty stomach.”
“Sir, Sir….,” I could not say any more.
“You have came to tell me that you have blisters
on your feet, that you cannot walk, isn’t it?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That is nothing new. Now get ready quickly.”

February 1984


 

I hung my head and rushed back to get ready. I had just


turned when I heard his voice again, “Listen, madam. You

will lead group number 7. You will have to help any member
who has difficulty climbing the mountain. You have
already been told about the responsibilities of a group
leader in the mountains.”
Tell

Have
you
ever
seen
the
mountains?
Have
you
also
climbed
a mountain? When and where?

How
far
have

A big responsibility
I started thinking about what a leader must do:
–
Help
others
in
carrying
their
bags.
–
Let
the
group
go
ahead
and
keep
to
the
last.
–
Help
those
who
cannot
climb
properly.
–
Find
a
good
place
to
stop
and
rest.
–
Look
after
those
who
are
not
well.
–
Arrange
for
food
for
the
group.
The most important thing is to be ready to be punished
even when some one else may have made a mistake.
I realised that there was a special kind of discipline here.
I wondered whether the camp will still be fun!
Up You Go!

Group no. 7

Group No. 7 included girls from Assam, Manipur, Mizoram,


Meghalaya and Nagaland. I was the only teacher from Kendriya


Vidyalaya in this group. I was happy to meet my new group


members. Most of them could not speak Hindi well. I still feel


bad that after being together for 21 days, I could not talk


even once with Khondonbi from Mizoram. She spoke only

Mizo. But in our hearts we grew close to each other.

Crossing the river...

We got vitamin C, iron tablets and hot chocolate milk with


our breakfast. These were given for strength and to keep us


warm in the cold. Every morning there would


be a medical check up. We tied our bandages

and counted the days left!

After an eight kilometre trek we reached a


river. There was a thick rope tied across the


river, from one bank to the other. The rope


was tightly fixed to pegs or ‘pitons’ on both


the sides. I was feeling nervous. I started


thinking what would happen if the rope came


out. I was trying to estimate how wide the

river was.

5 February 1984


 

Our instructor tied a rope around his waist and put a sling


(type of hook) in it. He then put the sling on the thick rope tied


across the river. Walking through the icy water, he went to the


other side. No one was ready to step into the fast flowing river.


Everyone was pushing each other to go first. I stood last in the


line hoping that no one would see me. Just then our instructor


came near me with the sling and rope in his hands. I knew


there was no escape now. I was ready, but did not have the


courage. Sir could guess my fears. He called out loudly, “Three


cheers for Sangeeta madam!” And before I knew it, someone

had gently pushed me into the water.

I felt as if my feet were frozen. I started shivering, my teeth


were chattering. I caught hold of the rope and started putting


my feet firmly on the river bed. As I walked further in, the river


got deeper and slowly the water reached upto my neck. In the


middle of the river I lost my balance and started slipping. I was


so scared and felt so cold, that the rope slipped from my hands.

I started shouting for help.

I was sure I would be carried away


by the river. But no, I found that I was


tied with the rope to the sling. “Hold


the rope! Hold the rope”, I could hear


the shouts. I somehow managed to get


hold of the rope and pull myself


forward. Slowly, with some courage, I


reached the river bank. I felt a special


kind of happiness as I came out of


the water. Happiness on finishing a


challenging task. Now, standing on


the bank, I was calling out to the others

to hold the rope tightly. I knew that this confidence was a result
of facing a challenge with courage.

Rock climbing

We had to climb 15 km to reach Tekla village. It was at a


height of 1600 metres. Our rucksacks had all that we may


need – food packets, water bottle, rope, hook, plastic sheet,


diary, torch, towel, soap, windcheater, whistle, glucose,


jaggery, chana and some other snacks.

We could see fruits and

vegetables growing in the


step fields. We saw Colonel


Ram Singh standing on a

90 metres high flat rock
with pegs and ropes.

We had been told to first


observe the rock carefully

and identify holds – places
where we can put our hands
and feet. Today I was not
going to back out. I stood first
in the line. Our instructor tied

a rope around his waist. He put the sling, and


held the thick rope which was hanging. He


started climbing as if he was running up. I


also put my sling. But as I took my first step,


I slipped. And there I was – swinging from the

rope!

“Keep your body at an angle of 90° while


climbing,” I heard. “Keep your back straight.

Do not bend.”

Keeping this in mind, I imagined the rock as


flat ground and started to climb up. Again while


coming down we had to use the rope, in a special


way called ‘rapling.’ I did this with the same

fearlessness.

A funny incident

It was evening. Khondonbi was feeling hungry. We did not


have anything to eat. She jumped over the fence and got


into a field. She quickly plucked two big cucumbers and


came back. Just then a woman came from behind and caught


hold of her bag. She started saying something to Khondonbi


in her own language. We could not understand what she


was saying. Khondonbi was trying to explain in her Mizo

language which we could not understand. I tried to explain


in Hindi but neither of them could understand it. Finally, I

folded my hands to say that we were sorry.

By then our group had gone far ahead. It was already


dark. I thought we had lost our way. Now we were really

scared.
We
could
not
see
anything
even
with
our
torches.
I

started sweating even though it was cold. I tightly held


Khondonbi’s hand. I called out loudly, “Where are you all?


Can you hear me?” My voice echoed in the mountains. We


both started to whistle loudly and flashed our torches.


Probably the group had noticed that we were missing. We


heard some whistles at a distance. I understood the signal.


We held each other's hand tightly and waited. Khondonbi


felt that we should keep talking. She started singing a Mizo


song loudly. After some time, we saw them coming towards

us. At last! We were with the group again.

A special guest
After dinner we met a special guest – Bachhendri Pal. She had just been

selected as a part of the team to climb Mount Everest. She had


come to seek the blessings of Brigadier Gyan Singh. It was a happy


evening – we were all singing. Bachhendri also joined us in singing


and dancing on the famous Pahadi song ‘Bedu Pako, bara masa,


kafal pako chaita, meri chhaila.’ At that time we had no idea that


Bachhendri would become the first Indian woman to reach Mount

Everest and create history.
Camp in the snow

We were standing at a height of 2134 meters. We were to spend


the night here. Everyone was busy trying to put up the tent. We


used double layered plastic sheets for the tent and for the ground.


The air between the layers would help to keep us warm. We put


in the pegs and began to put up the


tent. As we tied it from one side, the


wind flew the tent from the other side.


After quite a lot of pulling and tugging,


we managed to get the tent up. Then

we dug a drain around the tent.

We were feeling very hungry. We


collected some firewood and stones to


make a chulha and cooked some food.


After the meal, we collected all the waste


in a bag to clean the camp site. Soon


we got into our sleeping bags. I was not


sure if I would be able to sleep in it. Would it be comfortable?


Would I not feel cold? But the bags were filled with soft feathers,


which help in keeping us warm. We were all very tired. So very

soon we fell asleep.

Teacher’s Note : The children can be encouraged to learn the languages spoken

by their friends. This would help them appreciate and respect other languages.

The next morning we woke up and found
that it was snowing. White soft fluffy
snowflakes were gently falling. Wow! It was so
beautiful
!
The
plants,
the
trees,
the
grass
and
the mountains – everything looked white. Today
we were to climb higher, to 2700 metres. We
walked carefully on the snow with the help of

sticks. It was difficult because we kept slipping. By afternoon


we had reached snow covered mountains. We enjoyed throwing

snowballs at each other and making a big snowman.
Last day at camp

We were getting ready for the camp fire. Each group presented


a programme. We were enjoying – telling jokes and laughing,


singing and dancing around the camp fire. Soon it was midnight.


Brigadier Gyan Singh got up and called me. I thought, “Oh, no!


what have I done this time?” But when Sir announced my name


for the ‘Best Performance Award’ I stood still. He blessed me

and tears of joy rolled down my face.

Alone on the mountain top

A twelve-year old girl living in the mountains was out on a school picnic. She climbed a


mountain peak of 4000 metres with her friends. The girls had done this for fun and


adventure. Soon it was dark and they could not come down. It was also cold and scary.


They were alone without any food and it was a long night. This happened to Bachhendri

Pal, played when she was a young girl.

Bachhendri grew up in Nakuri village in the Garhwal area of Uttarakhand. When


she grew older, she joined Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi. Her guide


was Brigadier Gyan Singh. Bachhendri did very well in her training. She started to


train women in mountaineering courses. In 1984, Bachhendri was selected as a team

member to climb the Mount Everest.
Snow storm

There were seven women in that 18 member team. On the night of 15th May the team


was very tired after having reached a height of 7300 metres. The team put up their


tents and went to sleep. Around midnight they heard a loud sound and then a bang.


Before they were fully awake, the tent flew off and something very heavy hit them. There


was a terrible snow storm. Bachhendri was almost buried under the snow and was hurt


on the head. Many of the team members were also injured. The others used snow-picks

and axes to dig out those who had been buried under the snow.

The rest of the team members returned to base camp but Bachhendri went ahead,


climbing slowly but steadily towards the peak. It was seven minutes past one o’clock in


the afternoon of 23th May when Bachhendri Pal stepped onto the peak of 8900 metre

high Mount Everest also called Sagarmatha in Nepal.

There was another team member with her. There was no space for two people to


stand on the top at the same time. One slip and they would fall straight down-thousands


of feet below! Bachhendri and her team-mate dug into the snow and pitched their axe


firmly in the ice. Using this as a hook, they tied themselves to it with a rope. Only then


two of them could stand there. She was shivering with cold but filled with the warmth of


achievement. She bowed her head, pitched the national flag and took photographs. She

spent 43 minutes on the highest peak in the world.
Bachhendri Pal became the first Indian woman and the fifth woman in the world to
reach the peak of Mount Everest.

Teacher’s Note : Teachers can either make available the photographs or if possible


the actual mountaineering equipment like sling, pitons, hunter shoes, sleeping

bag etc. This will help discussion with children.
