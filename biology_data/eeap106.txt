6. Every Drop Counts
Long Long Ago

This is a picture of Ghadsisar. Sar means a lake. King Ghadsi


of Jaisalmer got it made 650 years ago with the help of the


people. All around the lake there are ghats with steps leading


to the water, decorated verandahs, large halls, rooms and


much more. People came here to celebrate festivals and for


programmes of music and dance. Children came to study in


the school on the ghat. The talab belonged to everyone and

everyone took care to keep it clean.

Rainwater collected in this lake spread over many miles.


It was made in such a way that when the lake was full, the


extra water flowed into another lake at a lower level. When


that too filled up, the


extra water flowed into


the next lake. This way


all nine lakes filled up.


This rain water could be


used throughout the


year. Today, Ghadsisar is


no more in use. Many new


buildings and colonies


have come up in between


those nine lakes. Now the


water does not get

collected in these lakes. Rain water just flows away and is
wasted.

Through the eyes of Al-Biruni

More than a thousand years ago, a traveller came to


India. His name was Al-Biruni. The place that he came


from is now called Uzbekistan. Al-Biruni carefully


observed and noted down the details of all that he saw.


He wrote especially about those things that he found


very different from his own country. Here is a part of what he

wrote about the ponds of that time.

The people here are very skilled at making ponds. My


countrymen would be surprised to see them. They pile up huge


rocks and join them with iron rods to build chabutaras (raised


platforms) all around the lake. Between these, there are rows


of long staircases, going up and down. The steps for going up

and coming down are separate. So there is less crowding.

Today when we study history, we can learn a lot about those days


from the writings of Al-Biruni. (This stamp came out in 1973, one

thousand years after his birth.)

water all round the year. And yet, most of the villages in


these areas did not have a shortage of water. People knew


that every drop of water was precious. Lakes and johads


were made to collect water. Water was


everyone’s need. One and all came


together in this work – be it a


businessman or a labourer. Some water


from the lakes soaked into the ground


and reached the wells and bavdis


(stepwell). The soil of the area also

became wet and fertile.

Every house had a system to collect


the rain water. Look at the picture on


your right. How do you think the


rainwater that falls on


the roof will reach the


underground tank?

Draw the path.

Have you ever seen


a stepwell? Look at


the picture. Can you


imagine by looking at


the picture that the


steps go down several


storeys deep? Instead


of drawing the water up from the well, the people could go


down the steps and reach the water. That is why they are

called stepwells.

Teacher’s Note : How does the earth soak water and how does it reach wells and

stepwells? This can be discussed with children.

Long ago, people used to make long journeys with their


caravans of animals and goods. People felt it was a good


thing to give water to thirsty travellers. Thus, they built

many beautiful stepwells.

Customs related to water

Even today people get water from very old lakes, dharas,


stepwells and naulas. Many customs and festivals are related


to water. At some places,


whenever lakes get filled up


with rainwater, the people


gather around the lake to

celebrate.

See the bride of Uttarakhand


in this picture. After getting


married she has come to the


new village. She bows to the


spring or the pond. In cities


one can see an interesting


form of this custom. The new


bride worships the tap in her home. Can we even imagine life

without water?

shining yellow pot of brass is seen in the other picture. Many

Think over it!

In 1986, there was no rain in Jodhpur and the surrounding areas.


People remembered the old and forgotten stepwell (baoli). They


cleaned the stepwell and more than two hundred trucks of garbage


was taken out of it. People of the area collected money. The thirsty


town got water from the stepwell. After a few years it rained well

and again the stepwell was forgotten.
Discuss

There are two old wells in the area where Punita lives. Her


grandmother says that about fifteen - twenty years ago there


was water in these wells. The wells could have dried up

because:

The story today
Let us see the different ways in which people manage water today.
See page 57 and discuss.

Do you get water in your house by any of these ways? Put a tick (✓)

on that. If you get water by some other way, write in your notebook.

Teacher’s Note : Discuss the unequal distribution of water with children. It is


important to know how people get water from different sources and the problems


they face. Though it is challenging, yet it is important to discuss issues of caste

and class related to water, especially from the chilldren’s perspective.

Looking Around


 
A Jal Board water tanker
comes to our colony twice a
day. We have to stand in a
long queue to get water from
the tanker. People at times
have fights over water.
We fill water from the well.
The nearby well dried up a
year ago. Now we have to
walk far to reach the other
well. We are not allowed to
take water from some of the
wells because of our caste.
We get water at home for
half an hour. We fill this in
the tank to use all day.
Sometime it is dirty.
We get water from our taps,
all day long.
This is how
we get
water
There is a handpump
nearby, but the water that
we get from it is salty. We
have to buy water for
drinking.
We have put a pump
directly in the Jal Board
pipeline. Now we don't have
any problem!
Every Drop Counts
We have put a motor to
pump up the water from
the borewell. But there is
no electricity, so what do
we do!
We get water from the canal
itself.

Looking Around


 
It can be done

There are some groups that work hard to bring water to the


people of different areas. They ask the elders about the water


arrangement in their times. They rebuild the old lakes and


johads, and also build new ones. Let us see how the group

called Tarun Bharat Sangh helped Darki Mai.

This is Darki Mai. She lives in a village in the Alwar district of


Rajasthan. The women of the village used to spend the entire


day looking after their home and animals. Sometimes, it took


them all night to pull water from the well for the animals. In the


summer, when the wells dried up, they had to leave the village.


Darki Mai heard about this group and asked for help. Together,


the people from the group and the village decided to make a


lake. The problem of food and water for animals is now less.

People get more milk. They have started earning more.
