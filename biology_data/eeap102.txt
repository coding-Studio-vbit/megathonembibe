2. A Snake Charmer’s Story
I am Aryanath

I can do something special which


I am sure none of you can do!


Do you know what? I can play


the been! You must be surprised.


Yes, I can make snakes dance


by playing the been. I have learnt


this art from my family


members. We people are known


as Kalbeliyas.


My grandfather Roshan Nathji


was famous amongst our people.


He could easily catch many


poisonous snakes. He tells me


many stories about his past.


Come, listen to his story in his own

words–

Designs of this kind are
used in rangoli,
embroidery and as wall
decoration in Saurashtra,
Gujarat and South India

Teacher’s Note : Talk to the children about their experiences related to snakes


before starting with this narrative. This would make the lesson more interesting.

A Snake Charmer’s Story

Dadaji remembers

From the time of my grandfather and great grandfather, we


have always been saperas (snake-charmers). Snakes have


been an important part of our life. We used to move from


village to village carrying our snakes in bamboo baskets.


Whenever we stopped in a village, a


crowd would gather around us. We


would then take out our snakes from

our baskets.

Even after the show, people would


stay on. They knew that in our tinbox


there were many types of medicines


for them. We made these medicines


from plants collected from the forests.


I had learnt all this from my


grandfather. I felt nice that I could


help people with my medicines even


if doctors and hospitals were far off.


In return, people would give us some


money or foodgrains. In this way we

could manage our life.

Sometimes, I was called to places


where someone had been bitten by a snake. From the marks


of the bite I tried to find out which snake had bitten the person.


I would then give a medicine for that. But I have not always


been on time to help. As you know, some snake bites can


even cause death on the spot. But most of the snakes are

not poisonous.

Sometimes, when some farmers would come running for


help shouting “snake, snake”, I would catch that snake.

Looking Around


 
After all, catching snakes was something I had been doing
since my childhood.

Oh, those were the good days. We could help a lot of people


in many ways. We also entertained them. It was not like today

when everyone watches TV for entertainment.

When I grew older, my father taught me how to remove their


poisonous teeth (fangs). He also taught me how to close the

tube of poison in the snake’s mouth.

What can we do

Aryanath! your father used to travel with me ever since he was


a young child. He learnt to play the been without being taught.


These days it is diffcult. Now the government has made a


law that no one can catch wild animals and keep them. Some


people kill the animals and sell their skins at high prices. So


they made a law against this. Now, with this law, how will we


earn our livelihood? We people have never killed snakes, and


sold their skin. People say that we keep the snakes in bad


Teacher’s Note : If possible, explain about poisonous fangs, ducts and their

removal by showing visual aids.

Musical instruments used in been party

Been, tumba, khanjiri and dhol. Except dhol all


the other three instruments are made from dried


gourd (lauki)


conditions. If we wanted, we too could have earned a lot of


money by killing snakes. But we would never do that. Snakes


are our treasure, that we pass on from one generation to


another. We even gift snakes to our daughters when they get


married. In our Kalbelia dance we also have movements similar


to the dance of the snake.


Aryanath, you will have to


make a different life for


yourself. You have got your


father’s gift of playing the


been. You and your


cousins can form a been


party and entertain people.


But do not waste this


knowledge about snakes


you have got from your

elders.

Share your knowledge


about snakes with children


who live in


towns and cities. Tell them, that they should


not be scared of snakes. Help them to recognise

poisonous snakes.

Tell them how snakes are friends of the


farmers. They eat the rats in the fields, otherwise

rats would eat the crops.
Now you tell our story. Also make a new story
of your life, to tell your grandchildren.

Kalbeliya dance


Teacher’s Note : This narrative focuses on the relationship and interdependence


between snake-charmers and snakes. By talking about more such communities


it can be clarified that most of them do not treat animals badly (which is a common

perception). We should also not hurt/tease animals.

Do you know?

Of the many kinds of snakes found in our country,


only four types of snakes are poisonous. They are:


Cobra, Common Krait, Russel’s Viper (Duboiya),

Saw-scaled Viper (Afai).
Cobra

A snake has two hollow teeth (fangs). When it bites,


the poison enters the person's body through the

fangs. There is a medicine for snake bites.
The medicine is made from the snake's poison and
is available in all government hospitals.
