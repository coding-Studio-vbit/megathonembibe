1. Super Senses
Has this ever
happened to you?

You were eating in the


playground, an eagle flew


down and took away your


roti.


You dropped something sweet on


the ground and within minutes

many ants collected around it.

As you walked softly past a


sleeping dog, its ears shot up

at once.
Why does it
happen? Think
and tell

Animals also have different senses. They can see, hear,


taste, smell and feel. Some animals can see their prey from


far away. Some can hear even the faintest sound. Some


animals can find their friends by their smell. The animal

world is full of examples of amazing senses!

How did the ant recognise a friend?

An ant was going along on the ground. It saw a group


of ants coming from the other side. The first ant quickly


came back to its hole. The ant guarding the hole

recognised it and let it in.
Think and Tell

 How did the ant know that the other ants

were not from its group?

 How did the guard ant recognise this ant?

Try this and write
Drop some sugar, jaggery or anything sweet on the ground.
Wait until the ants come there.

How
long
did
it
take
for
the
ants
to
come?

Did
one

Teacher’s Note : Children of this age are interested in animals. Encourage them


to share their experiences. Children should be supported to carry out observation

activities which require patience.

Looking Around


 
Now carefully, without harming the ants, block their path
for a while with a pencil.

Now
observe,
how
do
the
ants
move?

Many years ago a scientist did many experiments like this.


He found out that as the ants move, they leave a smell on the

ground. The other ants follow the smell to find the way.

Now
can
you
guess
why
the
ants
behaved
like that when you blocked their path?
Some male insects can recognise their
females by their smell.

Have
you
ever
been
troubled
by
mosquitoes?

Just think, how do they know where

you are?

Mosquitoes can find you by the smell of your


body. They also find you by the smell of the

sole of your feet and the heat of your body.

I am a silk worm. I


can find my female

worm from many
kilometres away by
her smell.

Have
you
seen
a
dog
sniffing
here

and there? What do you think it is

trying to smell?

Dogs mark out their own area on


the road. They can make out if another


dog has come into their area by the

smell of its urine or potty (latrine).

Why so?
Today Rajni had to go out for some
important work. She had to leave her six-
month old son Deepak with her sister
Sushila. Sushila also has a baby of
the same age. It was funny that both

the babies did potty at the same


time. She happily cleaned her

daughter but when she was cleaning
her sister’s son Deepak, she covered

her nose with her dupatta (scarf).

Think and discuss

Sushila
covered
her
nose
when
she
cleaned
Deepak’s

nappy, but not when she cleaned her daughter. Why do

you think she did this?

Is
a

‘good’
or
‘bad’
for
everyone
in
the
same
way?
Or does it depend on how each one feels about it?

Teacher’s Note : Sushila’s example illustrates a common situation in families.


Discuss with children how we often find a smell ‘bad’ when we think it is


from something dirty. If we analyse it, we may not be so offended by certain

smells.

Let’s see

Write
the
name
of
a
bird
which
has
eyes
in
front
of
its
head
(like in humans).

Write
the
names
of
some
birds
which
have
eyes
on
either

side of the head. What is the size of their eyes as compared

to the size of their head?

Most of the birds have their eyes on either side of the head.


Their eyes can focus on two different things at a time. When they

look straight ahead, both their eyes focus on the same object.

You must have seen birds moving their neck very often. Do


you know why? In most of the birds, eyes are fixed and cannot

move. So birds have to turn their heads to see around.
Looking with one or both eyes

Close your right eye or cover it with your hand. Tell your


friend to stand to your right, at some distance, and ask him

to do some action (wave hand, shake head, etc.)

Could
you
see
your
friend’s
action,
without
moving
your
neck?

Now
try
to
look
at
your
friend’s
action
with
both
your
eyes
open but without moving your neck.

What
was
the
difference
on
looking
with
one
or
both
eyes?

Teacher’s Note : When a bird focuses both eyes on an object, it can estimate the


distance. When its eyes focus on two different things, it increases its range of


vision. Children will understand this better, once they start observing the location


of eyes of different birds. While seeing with one eye and then with two eyes, children

will understand how with two eyes, the span of vision increases.

Looking Around


 

 Now toss a small ball or a coin and try to catch it. Try


this with both your eyes open. Then close one eye and

try to catch it. When was it easier to catch?

 Imagine how it would be to have your eyes in place of


your ears? What would you be able to do then, which

you cannot do now?

Some birds like kites, eagles, vultures can see four times


as far as we can. These birds can see things from a distance


of eight metres what we can see from a distance of two metres.


Now
can
you
guess
from
what
distance
can
an
eagle
in
the

sky can see a roti on the ground?

Do animals see colours?
Animals cannot see as many colours as we can. See how
things in these pictures will be seen by some animals.

It is believed that animals that are awake in


the daytime can see some colours. Those animals


that are awake at night can see things only in

black and white colours.

Tell
one

your
friends
to
stand
at
a
short

distance and ask him to say something softly.


The rest of you should listen carefully. Then all


of you put your hands behind your ears, as


shown in the picture. Let the same child say


something again as softly as before. In which


case was the sound sharper? Ask your friends

too.

 Put your hands over your ears and say

something. Can you hear your own voice?


Sit

a
desk.
Tap
the
desk
once
with

your hand. Listen carefully. Now put your


ear on the desk as shown in the picture.


Tap on the desk once again with your hand.


Listen again. Was there any difference in

the sound of the tap?

This is how snakes hear. They do not have external ears


(which you can see). They only feel the vibrations on the ground.

Sounds send messages

High
up
on
a
tree,
a
langur
warns
others
of

dangers like a tiger or leopard. The langur


does this by making a special warning call.


Birds
also
give
alarm
calls
to
warn
about

the danger. Some birds even have different


sounds for different kinds of dangers. For


example, there is a different warning call


if the enemy is coming from the sky or if

the
enemy
is
on
the
ground.

Fishes
give
alarm
call
by
electric
signals.

Some animals start behaving in a different way when an


earthquake or storm is about to come. People who live in


forests and can observe such behaviour of animals come to

know of the danger.

In December 2004, few tribes that live in the forests of


the Andaman Islands noticed the animals behaving in a


different manner. They guessed some danger. So they


moved away to a safer part of the island. Soon after, the


islands were hit by the tsunami but these people were

saved.

Dolphins also make different


sounds to give messages to


each other. Scientists believe


that many animals have a


special language of their own.

Write


some
animals?
Which animals?

 Do some animals understand your language?

Which ones?
Say it with sounds

Just like birds and dolphins you can also make your own


language of sounds for giving messages. Remember you have


to talk to your friends with only sounds and no words. How


and when will you need to give an alarm call? For example,

when the teacher is coming to the classroom!
Sleeping-waking
Some animals go into a long, deep sleep in certain seasons.
Then they are not seen for many months.

senses. Encourage children to find out more such animal senses from newspapers,

TV programmes, etc.

Sloth

It looks like a bear but is not. It is a sloth. It


spends almost 17 hours a day sleeping while


hanging upside down on a tree branch. The sloth


eats the leaves of the same tree on which it lives.


It hardly needs anything else. When it has eaten


enough leaves from that tree, it moves to the

nearby tree.

Sloths live for about 40 years and in that time


they move around only eight trees. Once a week

it comes down from the tree to relieve itself.

A tiger can see six


times better at

night
than
most
of
us.
The tiger’s whiskers
are very sensitive
and can sense the
movements or
vibrations in air.
They help the tiger
move in the dark
and find its prey.

A tiger’s sense of hearing


is so sharp that it can


make out the difference


between the rustling of


leaves and the sound of


an animal moving on the


grass. The ears of the tiger


can move in different


directions and this helps


to catch the sounds from

all around.
12

Tigers make different


sounds for different


purposes like when it is


angry or to call out to a


tigress. It can also roar or


snarl. It’s roar can be


heard upto 3 kilometres

away.

Each tiger has its own area


which may cover several


kilometres. Tigers mark


their area with their urine.


A tiger can at once come


to know if there is another


tiger in its area by the


smell of the urine. A tiger


will avoid going into

another tiger’s area.

Do you know that today many animals are killed and their


parts are sold? Elephants are killed for their tusks, rhinoceros


for its horn, tigers, crocodiles and snakes for their skins.


Musk deer are killed just to make a little scent from its musk.

People who kill animals are called hunters and poachers.

The number of tigers and many other animals in our country is reducing.


There is a danger that some of them will soon disappear. To protect the


animals, our government has made some forests as protected areas. Some


of them are the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttrakhand and ‘Ghana’ in


Bharatpur district of Rajasthan. In these areas nobody can hunt animals

or destroy the jungle.
