8. A Treat for Mosquitoes
Blood test

Rajat is back at school today. He had been absent for


many days. “How are you now?” asked Aarti. “I’m

alright,” Rajat replied softy.
Jaskirat
Jaskirat:
You
must
have
played
a
lot
while
you
were
at home.

Rajat : Who wants to play when you have fever! On


top of it I had to take a bitter medicine! I even had a

blood test.
Jaskirat:
A
blood
test?
Why?
It
must
have
been
very
painful.
Rajat

Rajat: Actually, when the needle pricked my finger, it


felt like an ant bite. They took 2-3 drops of blood, and


sent it for testing. That’s how we came to know that I

had malaria.

Nancy: But you get malaria when a mosquito bites you.


Rajat: Yes, but we find out by the blood test.

Nancy

Jaskirat: There are a lot of mosquitoes in my house

these days, but I did not get malaria.

Nancy: Who says that every mosquito bite causes


malaria? Malaria spreads only by the disease carrying

mosquitoes.
Aarti

Aarti: All mosquitoes look the same to me.


Rajat: There must be some difference.

Taking the blood on the glass slide for test
Malaria spreads through female
mosquitoes (Anopheles)

Nancy: Did they take the blood


from the place where the mosquito

had bitten you?

Dr Maryam looking at the blood slide


under the microscope. This microscope


makes things look thousand times bigger.


The details inside the blood can be seen


clearly. There are some microscopes which


make things look even more bigger than

this one.

Rajat: Of course not! How do I know when and where

the mosquito bit me?

Nancy: But how could they find out that you had


malaria by your blood test? Do you think they could

see something in the blood?

Medicine for Malaria

From early times, the dried and


powdered bark of the Cinchona

tree was used to make a
medicine for malaria. Earlier
people used to boil the bark
powder and strain the water

patients. Now tablets are
made from this.

Aarti: You know, I also had to get a blood test done. But they took


a syringe full of blood. The blood test showed that I had anaemia.


Rajat: What is that?


Aarti: The doctor said that there is less ‘haemoglobin’ or iron in


the blood. The doctor gave some medicines to give me strength.


He also said that I should eat jaggery, amla and more green leafy

vegetables, because these have iron.

Nancy: How can there be iron in our blood?


Jaskirat: There was something about this in the newspaper

yesterday.

Rajat (laughing) : So then you ate iron or what?!


Aarti: Silly! This is not the iron used to make these keys. I don’t


know exactly what it was. After I ate a lot of vegetables and

whatever the doctor had said, my haemoglobin went up.

Teacher’s Note : You can bring a blood report in the class and discuss with the children.

Jaskirat: There is a poster on malaria just outside our

They Spread Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya!
Are you inviting mosquitoes?
BEWARE!
Don’t let water collect around your house. Fill up the pits.
Keep the water pots, coolers and tanks clean. They should be
dried every week.
Use mosquito nets to protect yourself.
Spray kerosene if water has collected at some place.

Rajat: The poster says something about larvae. What are those?


Nancy: They are baby mosquitoes. But they don’t look like

mosquitoes at all.

Aarti: Where did you see them?


Nancy: There was an old pot lying behind our house. It was full


of water for some days. When I looked there I saw some tiny


thread-like grey things swimming. I was surprised when Mummy


told me that these had come out of the eggs


which mosquitoes lay in water. They are called

larvae. I also heard something about this on the
radio.

Rajat: What did you do?


Nancy: Papa immediately threw away the water.

He cleaned and dried the pot and kept it upside
down, so that no water would collect.

Jaskirat: Shazia aunty told me that even flies

spread diseases, especially stomach problems.

Rajat: But flies don’t bite. Then how do they

spread diseases?

Survey report
Some children did this survey. Here are some of their reports.
Group 1

We found something green around


the taps in our school which is


called algae. Due to algae (a kind


of plant) it had also become slippery


there. The algae spreads a lot during


the rainy season. We think that they


are some kind of small plants that

grow in water.
Tell

Is there a pond or river


around your house or


school? Go and look around

and observe these things:
Group 2

There is a pond near the school. At


first you cannot see the water in


the pond as it is completely covered


with plants. One aunty told us that


these plants have grown


themselves in water. Around the


pond there are pits full of water.


We also saw some larvae in the


water. As we moved around, lots of


mosquitoes flew from the plants


growing around. Jaskirat feels that


there are so many mosquitoes in


her house because of this dirty

pond nearby.

A scientist peeps into a mosquito’s stomach

This interesting incident took place almost a hundred years ago. A


scientist found out that mosquitoes spread malaria. Let's read about

this discovery in his own words.
Ronald Ross
74

“My father was a general in the Indian Army. I studied to become a


doctor, but what I really liked was reading stories, writing poetry, music

and drama. In my free time I enjoyed doing all this.
Looking Around


 

In those days, thousands of people used to die from a disease that we now call


malaria. The disease was found in areas where there was a lot of rain, or in swampy


places. People thought that the illness was caused by some poisonous gas that


came from the dirty swampy areas. They gave it the name 'malaria' which means


'bad air'. One doctor had seen tiny germs in the blood of one of the patients, when


he observed it under a microscope. But he could not understand how these had got

into the patient’s blood.

My professor had some ideas about this. “I think that these may be carried by


some kind of mosquito.” As his student, I spent all my time chasing mosquitoes, to


catch and observe. We used to carry empty bottles and chase mosquito after mosquito.


Then we would put the mosquitoes into a mosquito net in which there was a patient


of malaria. The mosquitoes would have a feast, biting these patients. The patients


were paid one anna for allowing one mosquitoe to bite them.


I will always remember those days at the hospital in Secundrabad – how we

used
to
cut
open
the
mosquito’s
stomach
and
peep
into
it.
I
would
spend
hours
and

hours bent over the microscope. By night my neck would be stiff and my eyes could


not see clearly! It used to be very hot but we dared not fan ourselves, as all the

mosquitoes would fly off in the breeze! Once I also fell ill with malaria.

I spent months like this with the microscope, but could not find anything. One


day we caught a few mosquitoes that looked different. They were brownish with


spotted wings. When I looked into the stomach of one of the female mosquitoes, I


saw something black there. I looked closer. I saw that these tiny germs looked just


like the ones that were found in the blood of malaria patients. At last we had the

proof! Mosquitoes did spread malaria!”

In December 1902, Ronald Ross got the highest award for his discovery—the


Nobel Prize for medicine. In 1905, even as he lay dying, Ross’s last words were, “I

will find something, I will find something new.”
What we have learnt
What can you do so that mosquitoes do not breed in
your house, school and neighbourhood?

How
can
you
find
out
if
someone
has
malaria?

Teacher’s Note : Tell children that ‘anna’ was a form of currency used earlier in


India. Use the story of Ronald Ross to encourage children to know and talk about


scientific processes. It is important to share with children that in an ordinary


hospital of Secundarabad many important experiments were done —


successful and some not so successful —

some

which led to an amazing discovery about


a disease which has still not been controlled. Collect more such exciting stories

on discoveries about different diseases and share with children.
